Code Implementation:

1. Define Command Interface:

src/com/homeautomation/Command.java

2. Implement Receiver Class:

src/com/homeautomation/Light.java

3. Implement Concrete Commands:

src/com/homeautomation/LightOnCommand.java

4. Implement Invoker Class:

src/com/homeautomation/RemoteControl.java

5. Test the Command Implementation:

src/com/homeautomation/HomeAutomationSimulator.java

Output:

Demonstrating Command Pattern for Home Automation:

--- Setting up Living Room Light commands ---
RemoteControl: Button pressed. Executing command...
Living Room Light is ON
RemoteControl: Button pressed. Executing command...
Living Room Light is OFF

--- Setting up Kitchen Light commands ---
RemoteControl: Button pressed. Executing command...
Kitchen Light is ON
RemoteControl: Button pressed. Executing command...
Kitchen Light is OFF

--- Reassigning Living Room Light button to turn on Kitchen Light ---
RemoteControl: Button pressed. Executing command...
Kitchen Light is ON

--- Empty Command Slot ---
RemoteControl: No command set for this button.
Explanation of the Command Pattern in this example:

Command Interface (Command):

Defines a single method, execute(). This is the common interface for all commands.
Receiver (Light):

The object that actually performs the work (e.g., turning on/off the light). It knows how to carry out the operations. The Light class has turnOn() and turnOff() methods.
Concrete Commands (LightOnCommand, LightOffCommand):

Each concrete command implements the Command interface.
Each concrete command knows about a specific Receiver object and a specific action to perform on that receiver.
For instance, LightOnCommand holds a Light object and, when execute() is called, it calls light.turnOn().
Invoker (RemoteControl):

The RemoteControl doesn't know anything about the concrete Light class or the specific turnOn()/turnOff() methods.
It only knows how to operate on the Command interface. It has a setCommand() method to load a command and a pressButton() method that simply calls command.execute().
Benefits of using the Command Pattern here:

Decoupling: The Invoker (RemoteControl) is completely decoupled from the Receiver (Light) and the actual operations (turnOn, turnOff). The Invoker only interacts with the Command interface.
Flexibility and Extensibility:
You can easily add new commands (e.g., FanOnCommand, StereoVolumeUpCommand) without changing the RemoteControl class.
You can change the behavior of a button dynamically at runtime by simply assigning a different Command object to it.
Undo/Redo Functionality: (Not implemented in this basic example, but a common benefit) By storing a history of commands, you can easily implement undo/redo functionality. Each command would also need an unexecute() method.
Queuing and Logging: Commands can be queued, logged, or sent over a network, as they are objects that can be stored and manipulated.
Macros: You can create composite commands that execute a sequence of other commands.
