Code Implementation:

1. Define Repository Interface:

src/com/customermanagement/CustomerRepository.java

Helper: Define a simple Customer Model

src/com/customermanagement/Customer.java

2. Implement Concrete Repository:

src/com/customermanagement/CustomerRepositoryImpl.java

3. Define Service Class:

src/com/customermanagement/CustomerService.java

5. Test the Dependency Injection Implementation (Main Class):

src/com/customermanagement/Application.java

Output:

Demonstrating Dependency Injection:

CustomerService: Initialized with a CustomerRepository instance.

--- Finding Customer 1 ---
CustomerService: Fetching customer details for ID: 1
CustomerRepositoryImpl: Searching for customer with ID: 1
Found: Customer [ID=1, Name=Alice Smith, Email=alice@example.com]

--- Finding Customer 3 (Non-existent) ---
CustomerService: Fetching customer details for ID: 3
CustomerRepositoryImpl: Searching for customer with ID: 3
Customer 3 not found.
Explanation of Dependency Injection in this example:

Dependency: In this scenario, CustomerService depends on CustomerRepository to perform its operations (like fetching customer data).

Problem without DI: Without Dependency Injection, CustomerService would typically create an instance of CustomerRepositoryImpl internally (new CustomerRepositoryImpl()). This creates a tight coupling, making it hard to change the repository implementation, test CustomerService in isolation (e.g., with a mock repository), or manage different repository configurations.

Solution with DI (Constructor Injection):

CustomerRepository Interface: This is crucial. CustomerService depends on this interface, not a concrete implementation. This adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) – depend on abstractions, not concretions.
CustomerRepositoryImpl Concrete Implementation: This is the actual implementation of the data access logic.
CustomerService Constructor: The CustomerService class has a constructor that receives an instance of CustomerRepository as an argument. It does not create the CustomerRepository itself.
Application (Composition Root): In the main method of Application, we perform the "wiring":
We first create an instance of CustomerRepositoryImpl.
Then, we pass that already created instance to the constructor of CustomerService.
Benefits of Dependency Injection:

Loose Coupling: CustomerService is no longer tightly coupled to CustomerRepositoryImpl. It only depends on the CustomerRepository interface. This makes the system more modular and flexible.
Testability: You can easily substitute CustomerRepositoryImpl with a mock or fake CustomerRepository implementation for unit testing CustomerService in isolation, without needing a real database.
Maintainability: Changes to the CustomerRepositoryImpl (e.g., switching from an in-memory map to a real database) do not require changes to CustomerService.
Reusability: CustomerService can be reused with different CustomerRepository implementations.
Configurability: You can configure which CustomerRepository implementation to use at startup without modifying the CustomerService code. This is especially powerful with DI frameworks like Spring.
