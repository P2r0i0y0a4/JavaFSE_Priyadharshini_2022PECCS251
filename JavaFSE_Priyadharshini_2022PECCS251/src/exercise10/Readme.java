Code Implementation:

1. Define Model Class:

src/com/studentmvc/Student.java

2. Define View Class:

src/com/studentmvc/StudentView.java

3. Define Controller Class:

src/com/studentmvc/StudentController.java

4. Test the MVC Implementation (Main Class):

src/com/studentmvc/MVCDemo.java

Output:

Demonstrating MVC Pattern for Student Records:

--- Initial Student Details ---
Name: John Smith
ID: S1001
Grade: B
-----------------------

--- Updating Student's Name and Grade ---
--- Student Details ---
Name: Jane Doe
ID: S1001
Grade: A+
-----------------------

--- Updating Student's ID ---
--- Student Details ---
Name: Jane Doe
ID: S1002
Grade: A+
-----------------------
Explanation of the MVC Pattern in this example:

Model (Student):

What it is: Represents the application's data, business logic, and rules. It is completely independent of the user interface.
In this example: The Student class holds the student's name, id, and grade. It provides getters and setters for these attributes. It doesn't know anything about how its data will be displayed or how user input will be handled.
View (StudentView):

What it is: Responsible for displaying the data from the Model to the user. It presents information in a user-friendly format. The View should not contain any business logic.
In this example: The StudentView class has a displayStudentDetails() method that takes student information (name, id, grade) and prints it to the console. It knows how to display the data, but not what the data means or how to change it.
Controller (StudentController):

What it is: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user input (though simplified here, as it's not a GUI), translates it into actions on the Model, and updates the View based on Model changes.
In this example: The StudentController has references to both the Student (Model) and StudentView (View).
It has methods like setStudentName() and setStudentGrade() that modify the Student Model.
It has getStudentName(), etc., to retrieve data from the Model.
Its updateView() method pulls the current state from the Model and pushes it to the View for display.
Interaction Flow:

The MVCDemo (acting as the client/application entry point) initializes the Model and View.
It then creates the Controller, injecting the Model and View into it.
When the MVCDemo wants to display student details, it asks the Controller to updateView(). The Controller fetches data from the Model and passes it to the View for display.
When the MVCDemo wants to change student details, it calls methods on the Controller (e.g., setStudentName()). The Controller then updates the Model. After updating the Model, the Controller typically tells the View to update itself to reflect the new Model state.
This separation of concerns makes the application more organized, maintainable, and flexible.
