 * Sorting Customer Orders
Scenario: You are tasked with sorting customer orders by their total price on an e-commerce platform. This helps in prioritizing high-value orders.

Goal: Implement and compare Bubble Sort and Quick Sort for customer orders.

Steps outlined in the document:

Understand Sorting Algorithms: Explain different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
Setup: Create a class Order with attributes like orderId, customerName, and totalPrice.
Implementation:
Implement Bubble Sort to sort orders by totalPrice.
Implement Quick Sort to sort orders by totalPrice.
Analysis:
Compare the performance (time complexity) of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.
Discuss why Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort.
Solution:

1. Understand Sorting Algorithms: 

Bubble Sort:
Concept: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. Larger elements "bubble" to the end.
Time Complexity: O(N^2) in worst and average cases, O(N) in best case (already sorted).
Stability: Stable (maintains the relative order of equal elements).
In-place: Yes.
Insertion Sort:
Concept: Builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It iterates through the input elements and inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.
Time Complexity: O(N^2) in worst and average cases, O(N) in best case (already sorted).
Stability: Stable.
In-place: Yes.
Good for: Small arrays or nearly sorted arrays.
Quick Sort:
Concept: A highly efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.
Time Complexity: O(N log N) on average, O(N^2) in worst case (rare, depends on pivot selection).
Stability: Unstable (does not guarantee the relative order of equal elements).
In-place: Generally considered in-place (requires minimal extra space for recursion stack).
Merge Sort:
Concept: Also a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into N sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). Then, it repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sorted sublist remaining.
Time Complexity: O(N log N) in all cases (best, average, worst).
Stability: Stable.
In-place: No, requires O(N) extra space for merging.
2. Project Setup:

Create a new Java project named SortingCustomerOrders.

3. Implementation:

Project Structure:

SortingCustomerOrders
├── src
│   └── com
│       └── orders
│           ├── Order.java
│           └── OrderSorter.java

4.OUTPUT:
Original Orders:
ID: 001, Customer: Alice , Price: $250.75
ID: 002, Customer: Bob , Price: $150.50
ID: 003, Customer: Charlie , Price: $300.00
ID: 004, Customer: David , Price: $100.25
ID: 005, Customer: Eve , Price: $200.00

Bubble Sorted Orders:
ID: 004, Customer: David , Price: $100.25
ID: 002, Customer: Bob , Price: $150.50
ID: 005, Customer: Eve , Price: $200.00
ID: 001, Customer: Alice , Price: $250.75
ID: 003, Customer: Charlie , Price: $300.00

Quick Sorted Orders:
ID: 004, Customer: David , Price: $100.25
ID: 002, Customer: Bob , Price: $150.50
ID: 005, Customer: Eve , Price: $200.00
ID: 001, Customer: Alice , Price: $250.75
ID: 003, Customer: Charlie , Price: $300.00
5. Analysis: 

Comparison of Performance (Time Complexity): 

Bubble Sort:
Worst Case: O(N^2)
Average Case: O(N^2)
Best Case: O(N) (if the array is already sorted, and the optimization to stop when no swaps occur is implemented).
Quick Sort:
Worst Case: O(N^2) (occurs rarely with poor pivot selection, e.g., already sorted array and always picking first/last element as pivot).
Average Case: O(N log N)
Best Case: O(N log N)
Why Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort: 

Significantly Faster for Large Datasets: The primary reason is its average-case time complexity of O(N log N), which is drastically more efficient than Bubble Sort's O(N^2) for large inputs. As the number of orders (N) increases, the performance gap widens exponentially.
For N=1,000, N^2 = 1,000,000, while N log N (base 2) is approx 1,000 * 10 = 10,000.
For N=1,000,000, N^2 = 1,000,000,000,000, while N log N is approx 1,000,000 * 20 = 20,000,000.
Practical Performance: Despite its theoretical O(N^2) worst case, Quick Sort's average case performance is excellent, and in practice, it's often the fastest comparison-based sorting algorithm due to its cache-efficient memory access patterns and low constant factors. Modern implementations use strategies (like median-of-three pivot selection, introsort) to avoid the worst case.
Inefficiency of Bubble Sort: Bubble Sort performs many unnecessary comparisons and swaps, even if elements are already close to their sorted positions. It's often taught as a simple sorting concept but is highly inefficient for practical use beyond very small arrays.
For prioritizing high-value orders on an e-commerce platform with potentially many orders, Quick Sort (or Merge Sort, or built-in Arrays.sort which uses a hybrid approach like Timsort) would be the practical choice for efficient sorting.
