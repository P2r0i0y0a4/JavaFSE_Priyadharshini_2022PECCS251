 * Inventory Management System
Scenario: You are developing an inventory management system for a warehouse. Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial.

Goal: Implement an inventory management system focusing on data structures and their operations.

Steps outlined in the document:

Understand the Problem:
Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
Setup: Create a new project for the inventory management system.
Implementation:
Define a class Product with attributes like productId, productName, quantity, and price.
Choose an appropriate data structure to store the products (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap).
Implement methods to add, update, and delete products from the inventory.
Analysis:
Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
Solution:

1. Understanding the Problem:

Why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories: 

Efficiency: Large inventories mean a lot of data. Without efficient data structures, operations like adding new products, updating quantities, finding a product, or removing discontinued items can become extremely slow, impacting warehouse operations and customer satisfaction.
Organization: Data structures provide a structured way to store and organize data, making it easier to manage and locate specific items.
Performance: Algorithms, coupled with appropriate data structures, dictate the speed at which operations are performed. For instance, quickly checking stock levels or processing orders relies heavily on optimized algorithms.
Scalability: A well-chosen data structure and algorithm can handle growth in inventory size without a proportional decrease in performance.
Suitable Data Structures: 

HashMap (or Hash Table): This is highly suitable for inventory management. It allows for very fast (average O(1)) lookups, additions, and deletions based on a unique key like productId. This is crucial for quickly finding products.
ArrayList (or Dynamic Array): Suitable if the order of insertion matters or if you frequently iterate through the entire inventory. However, searching for a specific product by ID would be O(n) (linear search), and deletions/updates by index can involve shifting elements.
TreeMap (or Balanced Binary Search Tree): Useful if you need to store products in a sorted order (e.g., by productId or productName) and perform range queries efficiently. Lookups, additions, and deletions are O(log n).
For an inventory system where quick access by productId is paramount, a HashMap is generally the most appropriate choice due to its average O(1) time complexity for core operations.

2. Project Setup:

Create a new Java project named InventoryManagementSystem.

3. Implementation:

Project Structure:

InventoryManagementSystem
├── src
│   └── com
│       └── inventory
│           ├── Product.java
│           ├── Inventory.java
│           └── InventoryTest.java
Output:

Products in inventory after addition:
ID: P001, Name: Laptop, Quantity: 10, Price: $999.99
ID: P002, Name: Smartphone, Quantity: 20, Price: $499.99
ID: P003, Name: Tablet, Quantity: 15, Price: $299.99

Products in inventory after update:
ID: P001, Name: Laptop, Quantity: 8, Price: $949.99
ID: P003, Name: Tablet, Quantity: 15, Price: $299.99

Products in inventory after deletion:
ID: P001, Name: Laptop, Quantity: 8, Price: $949.99
ID: P003, Name: Tablet, Quantity: 15, Price: $299.99

4. Analysis: 

Time Complexity of Operations (using HashMap):

Add (addProduct):
Average Case: O(1) - On average, adding a new product to a HashMap takes constant time. This involves hashing the key and placing the value.
Worst Case: O(n) - In the rare worst case (due to hash collisions or poor hash function), it could degenerate to O(n) if all elements fall into the same bucket, requiring a linear scan. However, for well-designed hash functions, this is very uncommon.
Update (updateProduct, updateProductQuantity):
Average Case: O(1) - Similar to add, finding the product by its ID (key) in a HashMap is O(1) on average. Once found, updating its attributes is a constant time operation.
Worst Case: O(n) - Again, in the worst case with severe hash collisions.
Delete (deleteProduct):
Average Case: O(1) - Removing an entry by key in a HashMap is O(1) on average.
Worst Case: O(n) - Due to hash collisions.
Search (findProductById):
Average Case: O(1) - The primary reason for choosing HashMap.
Worst Case: O(n) - Due to hash collisions.
Optimization: 

Good Hashing Function: For custom objects used as keys (if productId were an object itself), ensuring a well-distributed hashCode() and correct equals() implementation for the Product class is crucial to maintain O(1) average performance. (In this case, String's default hashCode() is usually good).
Initial Capacity and Load Factor: For very large inventories, choosing an appropriate initial capacity for the HashMap and understanding its load factor can help minimize rehashes (which are O(n)) and maintain performance.
Batch Operations: For mass updates or additions, consider batch processing where possible to reduce overhead.
Indexes for Other Fields: If searching by productName or category becomes frequent, you might need additional data structures (like another HashMap mapping names to product IDs, or a TreeMap for sorted lookups) to optimize those specific searches beyond O(n) for the primary HashMap.
Concurrency: For multi-user systems, use ConcurrentHashMap to handle simultaneous access to the inventory efficiently and safely, avoiding manual synchronization.
